-- Does the following statement use the Data Definition Language (DDL) or the Data Manipulation Language (DML) component of SQL?

SELECT column_name FROM my_table;

-- DML
-- SELECT will make a query of the data in the database.  It does not
-- manipulate the structure of the data (DDL), but rather the data
-- itself.
